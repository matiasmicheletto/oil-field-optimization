# Oil field optimization

This repository provides the source code for a command-line based optimization software.  

## Problem description
The program computes the optimal selection of pumpjacks whose rates must be adjusted in order to increase or reduce the total gross production of an oil field, while maximizing the total net production.  

In some way, the problem is similar to the subset sum problem, as a subset of wells must be chosen to minimize the subset size and maximize the net values.  

This problem becomes relevant when the field production is limited by the storing battery, and production rate (in mÂ³/day) needs to be modified.
